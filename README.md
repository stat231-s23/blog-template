# STAT 231 Blog project template

Professor Bailey will create a landing page that links to all the blog posts generated by project groups this semester. 

The landing page will include an image and a blurb for each blog. The blurb will be the first paragraph of your blog page, and the default image will be some random gif selected by Prof Bailey.

When your group is ready (and no later than December 5), please submit an image or gif of your choice to Prof Bailey to accompany your blog blurb on the landing page. The file can be a link to where the image or gif is hosted or the actual file itself (acceptable formats are PNG, PDF, JPG, and GIF).
